# 👋 Hello, I'm Arda Yüksel!

With over 3 years of experience in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Applied AI**, and **Machine Learning**, I focus on advancing AI's potential while ensuring robust and safe implementations. Currently, I am a **PhD Candidate** at **TU Darmstadt**, specializing in **Multimodal Fact Checking** and **Large Language Models (LLM)**, bringing AI-powered interactions to life. I am affiliated with **UKP Lab** and **TrustHLT**.

I started my AI and NLP journey as an undergraduate researcher in KOÇLAB at Bilkent University. During my years in AI, I developed word embedding models, created benchmarks for LLM, and fine-tuned transformers and vision models for specific tasks. In addition to this, I have been previously affiliated with Fraunhofer IKS, where I designed and tested **safe ML systems** to drive trustworthy AI solutions. Before my PhD, I was an **AI Developer** at **Neuland AI** where I designed **RAG** based ChatBots using Vector Databases and Knowledge Graphs.
